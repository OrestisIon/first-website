# README and VIDEO

Your _readme_ goes here

Your _video_ must replace the `demo.mp4` file in this folder

Before submitting your coursework, run `./clean.sh` as this will remove the virtual environment which can be reconstructed locally.

First thing in the website, there is a login requirement. I you are a new user you can create a new account
by pressing the easily accessible button and completing the required form.
Once register then user can sign in. There is a menu bar where the user can access the different parts of the website.
Firstly the user can add friends by writing their emails. Then the user can create Groups, where each group they
choose who from their friends to include. After creating groups, the user can then create bills and
specify to which group the bill will be distributed. The application will then split the amount and create a bill for
each user in the Group. When each of the users in the new bill log into their page they will be notified that a new bill has 
been added. Each user who has a bill can check the he paid the bill, see who already paid the bill, and view the bill balance

All the forms are checked with JQuery-AJAX, therefore there is a responsive interaction between the form and
the customer.
The website is also integrated such that a scroll bar makes an appearance when not all the data can be shown.

## Getting Started
The first step when visiting our website is to create an account or log in if you're an existing user. For new users, we've made it simple and accessible - just click on the "Create Account" button and complete the required form. Once registered, you'll have access to all the features our platform offers.

## Navigation
Our website features an intuitive menu bar that provides easy access to various sections of the platform, ensuring you can quickly find what you need.

## Connecting with Friends
One of the key features is the ability to connect with friends. You can add friends by entering their email addresses, making it effortless to build your network.

## Organize with Groups
Create custom groups and decide which friends to include in each group. This feature allows you to manage your connections efficiently.

## Managing Bills
Once you've organized your friends into groups, you can start creating bills. Specify the group to which the bill will be distributed, and our application will handle the rest. It will automatically split the amount and generate a bill for each user in the group.

## Stay Informed
When a new bill is created, users in the group will be notified upon logging into their account. This ensures that everyone is aware of new financial obligations.

## Bill Tracking
Users with bills can easily check if they've paid a bill, see who else has paid, and view the current bill balance. This feature simplifies group expenses and keeps everyone informed.

## Responsive Interaction
All our forms are equipped with JQuery-AJAX, guaranteeing a responsive and seamless interaction between you and the platform.

## Scrollable Content
For your convenience, our website dynamically displays a scrollbar when not all data can fit on the screen, making sure you can access all relevant information effortlessly.

## Installing
Once installed run `./clean.sh` to remove the virtual environment which can be reconstructed locally.
